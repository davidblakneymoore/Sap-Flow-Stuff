# Sap-Flow-Stuff

This repository contains a CRBasic program that collects sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in single-ended mode. In this program, both the heat-ratio method (Burgess et al., 2001) and the maximum-heat-ratio method (J. Gutierrez Lopez, unpublished) are used to measure sap flow. This program does not record raw sap flow data.

This repository also contains an R script for processing these data.
