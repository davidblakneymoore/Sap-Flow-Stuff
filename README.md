# Sap-Flow-Stuff

This repository contains two CRBasic programs. One collects sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in differential mode, sap yield measurements, and sap pressure measurements. The other collects sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in single-ended mode, fine-scale diameter fluctuation measurements, wood water content measurements, sap pressure measurements, and soil temperature measurements. In both of these programs, both the heat-ratio method (Burgess et al., 2001) and the maximum-heat-ratio method (J. Gutierrez Lopez, unpublished) are used to measure sap flow. Neither of these programs record raw sap flow data.
