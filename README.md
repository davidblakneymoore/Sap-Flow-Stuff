# Sap-Flow-Stuff

This repository contains two CRBasic programs. One collects sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in differential mode, sap yield measurements, and sap pressure measurements. The other collects sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in single-ended mode, fine-scale diameter fluctuation measurements, wood water content measurements, sap pressure measurements, and soil temperature measurements. In both of these programs, both the heat-ratio method (Burgess et al., 2001) and the maximum-heat-ratio method (J. Gutierrez Lopez, unpublished) are used to measure sap flow. Neither of these programs record raw sap flow data. The first program is for a project entitled 'Developing and Testing a Novel Tap Design for Increasing Sugarbush Sap Yields and Sustainability Through Research, Extension, and Producer Partnerships' that's funded by the United States Department of Agriculture's Acer Access and Development Program, and the second program is for a project entitled 'Diversifying the Maple Syrup Industry to Enhance Socioecological Resilience and Ecosystem Services' that's funded by the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative program.

Eventually, I'll add the R code I'll use to process these data to this repository too.
