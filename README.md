# Sap-Flow-Stuff

This repository contains two CRBasic programs. One collects sap yield measurements, sap pressure measurements, and sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in differential mode. The other collects fine-scale diameter fluctuation measurements, wood water content measurements, sap pressure measurements, soil temperature measurements, and sap flow measurements using heat-pulse sap flow sensors read in single-ended mode.
